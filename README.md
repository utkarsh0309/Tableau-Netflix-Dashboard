Data Analysis of Netflix dataset

# SOURCE OF DATASET
A dataset is a collection of organized data that is used for analysis and research purposes. The 
data can be organized in different formats, including tabular data, document files, images, and 
videos, among others. In a tabular dataset, each column represents a variable, while each row 
corresponds to a record of the data set. One of the popular platforms for finding and publishing datasets is Kaggle.com. Kaggle.com 
provides a web-based data science environment for users to explore and build models, 
collaborate with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and create competitions 
to solve data science challenges. Kaggle.com has over 90,000 public datasets and 200,000 public notebooks, making it a rich 
source of data for analysis. The platform has a community of around 3 million people who 
actively contribute to the platform by publishing datasets, creating models, and participating 
in competitions. For this project, I utilized a dataset I found on Kaggle.com that contains details of tv shows 
and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Fixable which is a 
third-party Netflix search engine. The dataset was in a tabular format, where each column 
represented a different variable, and each row corresponded to a record of the data set. I used 
this dataset to create a dashboard that visualizes the sales data of the company in the United 
States of America (USA). Overall, Kaggle.com is an excellent resource for data scientists and machine learning 
engineers, as it provides a vast collection of public datasets and a collaborative platform to 
work on data science projects.

# WHY NETFLIX DATASET?
The dataset "TV Shows and Movies listed on Netflix" is an interesting collection of data that 
provides insight into the content available on Netflix as of 2019. It includes information about 
the TV shows and movies available on the platform and their release dates, duration, genres, 
and ratings, among other details. This dataset was collected from Flixable, which is a third-party search engine for Netflix.
One of the most interesting findings from this dataset is that the number of TV shows on Netflix 
has nearly tripled since 2010, while the number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 
titles. This suggests that Netflix has increasingly focused on producing and acquiring TV shows 
rather than movies in recent years.


I chose this dataset for analysis because it provides a unique opportunity to explore the content 
available on one of the world's largest streaming platforms. By analyzing this dataset, we can 
gain insights into what types of content are popular among Netflix users, how the availability 
of content varies by country, and how the platform's focus on TV shows versus movies has 
changed over time.

Additionally, integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings or 
Rotten Tomatoes can provide even more interesting findings. For example, we can explore how 
the ratings of Netflix content compare to those of other popular streaming platforms or how 
the popularity of certain genres varies across different regions of the world. Overall, this dataset 
presents a rich source of information for anyone interested in exploring the world of streaming 
entertainment.





# Conclusion of Analysis

As I analyzed the dataset and visualized the dashboard, I came to the conclusion that movies 
are more popular than TV shows. It was interesting to see that documentaries were the top 
genre, followed closely by stand-up. The highest viewership was found in the USA, which was 
not surprising considering the country's dominance in the entertainment industry.
Furthermore, I observed that the highest-rated content was TV-MA. It was fascinating to see 
that despite the prevalence of content warnings and age restrictions, audiences still gravitate 
towards mature-rated content. This suggests that people are drawn towards edgier, more adult-oriented content.
One interesting trend that emerged from my analysis was the fact that movies were more 
popular than TV shows in recent years. I think this could be due to the availability of a broader 
selection of movies on streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+. 
Additionally, movies tend to have a wider appeal than TV shows, which could explain their 
popularity.

In conclusion, the analysis of the dataset and visualization of the dashboard gave me 
valuable insights into the entertainment industry. The popularity of movies and certain 
genres could have implications for content production and distribution. It will be interesting 
to see how these trends continue to evolve in the future.
